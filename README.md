# DLJ-2: Debiased LLM-as-a-Judge for Logic Model Evaluation in Japanese Government Reviews

This repository contains the code, data, and evaluation scripts for our study:

> **A Debiased LLM-as-a-Judge Approach Reveals the
Risk of Evaluation Formalism in Japanâ€™s EBPM**  
> Masahiro Asami and Kai Fukunaga (2025)  
> [Preprint DOI:XXXXXXX]()

We propose a two-stage frameworkâ€”DLJ-2â€”that combines large language model (LLM) scoring with hierarchical Bayesian regression to assess the consistency and credibility of logic models submitted in Japanâ€™s administrative project reviews (RS System). This repository provides the full pipeline for replicating our experiments, including prompt templates, LLM outputs, regression scripts, and annotated data.
