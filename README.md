# DLJ-2: Debiased LLM-as-a-Judge 2 stage framework

This repository contains the code, data, and evaluation scripts for our study:

> **Uncovering the Risk of Evaluation Formalism: A Debiased LLM-as-a-Judge Study in Japan's Government Project Reviews**  
> Masahiro Asami and Kai Fukunaga (2025)
> , Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=5249953 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5249953

We propose a two-stage frameworkâ€”DLJ-2â€”that combines large language model (LLM) scoring with hierarchical Bayesian regression to assess the consistency and credibility of logic models submitted in Japanâ€™s administrative project reviews (RS System). This repository provides the full pipeline for replicating our experiments, including prompt templates, LLM outputs, regression scripts, and annotated data.
